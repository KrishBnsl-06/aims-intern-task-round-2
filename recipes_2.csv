images/Beer_Bread.jpg,Beer Bread,fluffy malt loaf,"Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix dry ingredients and beer. Pour into a greased loaf pan. Pour melted butter over mixture. Bake 1 hour, remove from pan and cool for at least 15 minutes. UPDATED NOTES: This recipe makes a very hearty bread with a crunchy, buttery crust. If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top. Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a ""hard biscuit"" as some have described. That's because they aren't sifting their flour! If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it once the ""correct"" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product. I have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic beverages instead of beer. That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that you get a proper rise. The final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;). Thank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT! You will be amazed at the results you get.","1. Mix & Bake: Preheat oven to 375°F and cool for 15 minutes. Mix sifted dry ingredients with beer, pour into greased pan, top with melted butter, and bake for 1 hour.2. Sift Flour Crucial: For best results (not a ""brick""), sift flour or spoon it lightly into the measuring cup.... 3. Tips & Variations: For softer crust, mix butter into batter. If using non-alcoholic liquid, add yeast."
